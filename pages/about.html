            <h1>WHAT is OAS?</h1>
            <p>
                Octopus Attacks Shark!! [OAS] is a Seattle-based musical configuration mining the rich dark veins of disparate musics and synthesizing them into new forms with ritual intensity.
              OAS writes, reinterprets, perverts, and performs music drawn from such disparate genres as punk, garage, industrial, prog, hellhound blues, and twisted roots music.
            </p>

            <h3>Influences and History</h3>
            <p>
                Octopus Attacks Shark!! [OAS] originally formed as a TOOL cover project under the moniker
                <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gaping-lotus">"The Gaping Lotus Experience"</a> in 2019
                with the intent of playing through the Opiate EP in time for the album's 10,000th day
                anniversary. <i>(Nerds...)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once that silly project was done, they reformed as "Octopus Attacks Shark!!" to pursue
                their own creative works.
            </p>
            <p>
               In the modern era, OAS writes, reinterprets, perverts, and performs music drawn from such disparate genres as punk, garage, industrial, prog, hellhound blues, and twisted roots music.

        <div class="section">
            <h1>WHO is OAS?</h1>
            <p>
               Sonic synthesizers and tricky transformers hungry to perform ceremonies in the Temple of Song. 
            </p>

            <h3> ”Coyote”- Vocal Exhortations, Dissonant Harmonic(a) Waves, Purveyor of Dark Energy </h3>
            <p>
               Coyote hails from the salt-tanged, fog-haunted cypress groves and defiant cities of the North California coast. Outside of the band, they are a steward of relics in the vaults of The University and an agitator for decolonizing access to community collections.
            </p>

            <h3>Dirk Hortensius - Guitar Armourer</h3>
            <p>
                Dirk"alurka" Hortensius speaks guitar in a strange Canadian/Carolinian dialect. As soon as you
                take his instruments away he is an utterly completely incomprehensible nerd, usually caught
                somewhere between rants about politics, Star Wars, and minute details of engineering design
                - somehow all at the same time.
            </p>

            <h3>Shiva Shrivastava - Drum Captain of Time and Space</h3>
            <p>
                "Cap'n" Shiva Shrivastava controls time and space - but only according to his watch. Shiva
                daylights as a Software Engineer, whiskey connoseiur, and dog-dad.
