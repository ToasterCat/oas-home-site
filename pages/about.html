            <h1>WHAT is OAS?</h1>
            <p>
                Octopus Attacks Shark!! [OAS] is a Seattle-based musical act dabbling in punk, metal,
                blues, and whatever genre may be unfortunate enough to attract a case of creative ADD
                next week.
            </p>

            <h3>Influences and History</h3>
            <p>
                Octopus Attacks Shark!! [OAS] originally formed as a TOOL cover project under the moniker
                <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gaping-lotus">"The Gaping Lotus Experience"</a> in 2019
                with the intent of playing through the Opiate EP in time for the album's 10,000th day
                anniversary. <i>(Nerds...)</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once that silly project was done, they reformed as "Octopus Attacks Shark!!" to pursue
                their own creative works.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the modern era, OAS writes and performs music in the punk/industrial/prog genres,
                with an experimental blues/country twist.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>WHO is OAS?</h1>
            <p>
                Whoever you want us to be - if you've got a costume ready.
            </p>

            <h3>Conor Casey - Vocal Coyote</h3>
            <p>
                Conor "Coyote" Casey hails from the South-end of San Fancisco and takes sole responsibility
                for whatever special feelings you may be feeling. Outside the band, Conor is a full-time
                labor activist/archivist for the University of Washington.
            </p>

            <h3>Dirk Hortensius - Guitar Armourer</h3>
            <p>
                Dirk"alurka" Hortensius speaks guitar in a strange Canadian/Carolinian dialect. As soon as you
                take his instruments away he is an utterly completely incomprehensible nerd, usually caught
                somewhere between rants about politics, Star Wars, and minute details of engineering design
                - somehow all at the same time.
            </p>

            <h3>Shiva Shrivastava - Drum Captain of Time and Space</h3>
            <p>
                "Cap'n" Shiva Shrivastava controls time and space - but only according to his watch. Shiva
                daylights as a Software Engineer, whiskey connoseiur, and dog-dad.
            </p>
